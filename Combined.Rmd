```{r}
mydata = read.csv("cleaned_data.csv")
mydata
read.csv("train.csv")
```
By observation, variables "sunrise" and "sunset" are systematically missed in station 1,7,8,9,12,13,16,17 and 20.
For example, on 2012-01-01, 
```{r}
sun = data.frame(mydata[2], mydata[3], mydata[12], mydata[13])
sun[1:19,]
```
It is the same on other dates.
We will devide data sets into two groups: the ones with a station whose "sunrise" and "sunset" are collected, and the ones those datas are missing. Then we build models separately to better predict the results.

```{r}
asdf = data.frame(mydata[7:10])
pairs(asdf)
```

```{r}
asdfg = data.frame(mydata[15:19])
pairs(asdfg)
```

```{r}
asd = subset(mydata[8:10], dewpoint != "M" & wetbulb != "M" & heat != "M") 
pairs(asd)
```
